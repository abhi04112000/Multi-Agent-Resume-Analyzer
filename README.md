## Project Description

The Multi-Agent Resume Analyzer project aims to provide a detailed analysis of resumes and job descriptions using advanced AI models and frameworks. The system utilizes a Mixtral-8x7b LLM for SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis and recommendations. It integrates market research tools and employs a multi-agent framework to improve candidate-job fit and produce detailed analysis reports.

## Features

- **Resume Analysis:** Developed using Mixtral-8x7b LLM for SWOT analysis and personalized recommendations.
- **Market Research Integration:** Incorporated SerperDevTool and WebsiteSearchTool for enhanced market research and comprehensive analysis.
- **Multi-Agent Framework:** Engineered a multi-agent system with Crew-AI framework, including:
  - **Job Researcher Agent:** Gathers and analyzes job market data.
  - **Resume SWOT Analyzer Agent:** Performs SWOT analysis on resumes.
- **Semantic Matching:** Utilized s-BERT for semantic matching between resumes and job descriptions, resulting in a 30% increase in candidate-job fit.
- **User Interface:** Created a Streamlit-based interface for easy resume submission and detailed JSON report generation.
